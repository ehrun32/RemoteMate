## Project Summary

We propose to design and build a fully remotely controllable robotic arm which perfectly mimics
human arm movement, can pick up and clamp onto objects, and has tactile feedback based on
pressure asserted to objects. The movement of the robotic arm will be controlled via a wearable
glove that the operator wears, and there will be a central web application containing a live
camera view of the robotic armâ€™s workspace through an integrated lens on the robotic arm with
image processing. The web application will also control the robotic armâ€™s features which include
clamp pressure options, movement controls for extra axes of freedom, and movement sensitivity
options.
