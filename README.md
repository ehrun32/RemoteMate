A speech recognizer for Spotify commands

## Project Summary

This project is intended to create a speech recognition model that can be used to recognize Spotify commands. In the future, this model will be connected to a computer where given voice input, the model will process and recognize the command and execute it.

## Methodology

### Training Data Creation

1. Recorded 10 sample commands
2. Used Spotify's Pedalboard Audio Processor, to change: Reverb, Pitch, Loudness
3. Created 2000 examples for each sample command


## Next steps

Things to improve:

1. Train model 2 for longer (after getting hardware upgrade ðŸ˜¢, or use NVIDIA's cloud computing)
2. Implement execution on a computer
