## Project Summary
This project propose to design and build a fully remotely controllable robotic arm which perfectly mimics
human arm movement, can pick up and clamp onto objects, and has tactile feedback based on
pressure asserted to objects. The movement of the robotic arm will be controlled via a wearable
glove that the operator wears, and there will be a central web application which will control the robotic 
armâ€™s features which include clamp pressure options, movement controls for extra axes of freedom, and
movement sensitivity options.
